# Travel-Collab

## Introduction
**Travel-Collab** is a web application that allows multiple users to `collaboratively plan` and edit their travel itineraries.<br>
It integrates Google Maps for `intuitive route visualization` and OpenAI as a `smart trip assistant`, enabling a more personalized and efficient planning experience.

## System Architecture
- **Application Server**  
   Runs Express.js (Node.js) on AWS EC2, managed by Elastic Beanstalk
- **Database** 
   - **MySQL (AWS RDS):** Main relational database, accessed via Sequelize ORM
   - **Redis**  
  Used for two main purposes:  
      1. **Chat context storage**: Temporarily stores each user's recent conversation history (1 hour) to support context-aware replies from the AI assistant, while reducing OpenAI API token usage
      2. **Idempotency key caching**: Prevents duplicate processing of API requests by caching idempotency keys for 5 minutes
   - **SQLite:** Used as a lightweight file-based database for CI/CD (GitHub Actions) testing to ensure isolated and repeatable test cases
- **Storage**  
   - **AWS S3:** Uploads images to AWS S3
- **External API**   
   - **Google Maps API**: Supports geocoding (address-to-coordinates) and route visualization
   - **OpenAI API**: Supports an AI-based trip assistant that provides destination suggestions

## Quick start with Docker
### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Edwinaeded/travel-collab.git 
```
2. Navigate to the project directory
```
cd travel-collab
```
3. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file (see `.env.example` for reference)

4. Start the application using Docker
```
docker-compose up --build
```
5. Run database migrations and seed data
```
docker-compose exec app npx sequelize db:migrate
docker-compose exec app npx sequelize db:seed:all
```
6. Access the application at http://localhost:3000

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have **Node.js (v18.15.0)** and **npm** installed.
- Ensure you have **Redis** installed and running. 

### Steps
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Edwinaeded/travel-collab.git 
```
2. Navigate to the project directory
```
cd travel-collab
```
3. Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
4. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file (see `.env.example` for reference)

5. Create database  
   Ensure your database server (e.g., MySQL) is running, then create a new database.  
   If using Sequelize, you can run:
```
npx sequelize db:create
``` 

6. Run migrations to set up the database schema
```
npx sequelize db:migrate
```
7. (Optional) Seed database
```
npx sequelize db:seed:all
```
8. Make sure Redis server is running
```
redis-server
```
9. Start the development server
```
npm run dev
```
10. Access the application at http://localhost:3000
